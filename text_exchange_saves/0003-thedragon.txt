This is a result of changing the max word count to 15 and running for 10000 iterations. A similar experiment is underway using the same data set and doing 25 thousand iterations with a
 12 word count. It seems that word count does change the amount of average loss lowered per iteration. Average loss achieved at the end of training should be noted in these text
 documents from now on. Standard format for noting what created the AI:

Number of Training Iterations: 10000
Pairs of Input Data Trained On: 225279 sentence pairs
Average Loss Started:
Average Loss Ended:
