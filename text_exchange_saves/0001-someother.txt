Unit 0001 is a result of upping the max word count to 50, this was clearly too much and the number training iterations, 500 specifically, where obviously too low.

Because of that lack of training iterations the bot simply repeats lines 1 after another with no variance as all things are weighted similarly in the python dictionary.
