This one was training all night, I'm very curious to see how it names itself. I am preemptively creating the text file that will store the conversation with the data collected for
further analysis. After this I think it will likely be best to start incorporating more data.

Would you look at that? Viktor came back, but it's Vic this time, specifically Victor Frankenstein the Bowler. LOL!

This one clearly seems to be more coherent, actually producing some reasonable responses.
