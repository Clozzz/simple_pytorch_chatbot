This is unit 0000, a result of 4000 training iterations on IMDBs top 50 movies JSON data included with PyTorch's chatbot tutorial.

The tar file for this is still saved in the movie corpus dir, though in future unit iterations I will have a "master corpus" that will contain a master list of formatted pairs similarly
noted in the pytorch tutorial.

> Hello
Bot: hello . singer . singer .
> Hello
Bot: hello . singer . singer .
> Test
Bot: i m sorry . s daughter .
> test

Notice the repeating of lines on the same input. Will need to figure that out at some point. More natural language would allow for alternate responses.

Bot: i m sorry . s daughter .
> Say something else.
Bot: what ? ? ? ? ?
> How would you eat an apple?
Bot: i don t know . . !
> What is your name?
Bot: victor . is my name . .
> What is 2 + 2 
Bot: i m sorry i m sorry !
> What is 1 + 1
Bot: i m sorry i m sorry !
> What is 345 + 3954
Bot: i m sorry i m sorry !
> what is this + that
Bot: i m not going to kill you .

Important to additionally note that numbers and special characters are stripped by the regex in the python script - did not notice that on initial run through
of the imported code from the PyTorch tutorial.

> I hope not
Bot: you re not . . ! !
> I'm not what?
Bot: i m not crying . ! !
> Good, I don't want you to cry.
Bot: i ll be back . . .
> Arnold S

So this is my own neural net firing off, but I have an association of the phrases "Why do you cry?" and "I'll be back." from the Terminator series. Funny that this is almost
similar, I wonder if the terminator movies where in that data set?

> I'll be back
Bot: i ll be back .
> Will you be back?
Bot: i m not sure . . !
> Why not?
Bot: because you re still here . things .
