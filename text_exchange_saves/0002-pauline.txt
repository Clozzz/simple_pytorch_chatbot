This chat is the result of 10,000 iterations over the IMDB movie line pairs in addition to ~4000 question and answer pairs from Yahoo! Answers.

Still lacking noticeable understanding of inputs. Additionally, it appears that number and symbols are not recognized, this is because the python script pulls them.
Should I update the script to allow for numbers or momentarily remove arithmetic? Additionaly the input examination functions strip special characters so mental note that
adding a question mark does not aid in the presenting the question currently.
