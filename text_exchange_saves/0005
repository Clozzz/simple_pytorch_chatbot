This unit iteration will be training on the lines from the top 50 movies, select Yahoo! Answers questions, and now selected WIKI QA questions.

Number of Training Iterations: 15000
Pairs of Input Data Trained On: 226319
Trimmed to: 97422
Unique words: 11994
Max Sentence Length to Consider: 13
Average Loss Started: 9.3875
Average Loss Ended:

- Be sure to ask the standard set of questions, who/what/where are you? what time is it? how do you eat an apple? what color is a zebra? etc.
- I've previously concluded that a repeated input will give the same output, so the question is, do we begin to append input to the end of a typical input? If we used a randomiser
this would improve the likelyhood of unique answers. The random value should be small so as not to have much influence on the interpretation of the input and may only need 1 - 10
different characters appended one at a time. This would have to be done in the python code.

Two lines have been added to evaluateInput function in order to increase randomness of replies.
		random_letter_append = random.choice('a','b','c','d','e')
            	input_sentence = input_sentence + random_letter_append

We now have additional data, though only another 1000 lines, not very much, and a bit of new code to aid in unique output generation when given the same input.
Let's test - with 15k iterations at 13 words per sentence seem like a good average. We should aim for an average loss of < 2 or 2.5 at most.

Should also consider updating the script to print information provided in the format desired as shown above.

Also need to make a github repo for this.
